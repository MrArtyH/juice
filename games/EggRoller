**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A Egg, that rolls, that has to maneover obstacles and prevent itself from getting cracked.
**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

Well, I wouldn't say it would be fun, but more of a rage game.
Essentially, it's like Getting Over It, but with an egg that just rolls and jumps.
The rolling mechanic is a bit slippery, however.
It can, of course, like any other egg, *crack*, but i think theres some fun to that.
Still, its a rage game, so it will probably be pretty hard.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

You start off at, well, the start, and maneover your way through obstacles, which obstacles? I have no idea yet. But i promise something cool.
There will be only two checkpoints which are kind of secret and not easy to see, otherwise, youll spawn back to the beginning when you crack.
Theres also no restoring, if you fall, **you fall ðŸ˜ˆ**
Once you get to the end, you get.... nothing? Something? Guess you'll have to find out ;)

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
It depends on the person.
I assume most people spend atleast 30 minutes at trying to play the game, then probably rage quit.
The enviroment will change ever so often when you get higher and higher and thus closer to the finish.
